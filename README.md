The Duino Mining Module X4 is a breakout board for ESP32 Dev boards, which can be used to mine the cryptocurrency DuinoCoin. This project was made for a friend who mines the coin and wanted a better solution than having wires hanging all over the place. 

-   Allows easy access to individual ESPs using pin headers;
-   Easy to solder components;
-   Easy to use DC jack, no other wires needed;
-   Can hold up to 4x ESP32 boards;
-   3mm mounting screws allow easy mounting to a wall or other flat surface;
